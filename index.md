Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/donghwanleehome">Professor Donghwan Lee</a>. I received my Bachelor's degree from Korea University in 2021 and completed my Master's degree at KAIST in 2023.</p>

<p>
 My research centers on the theoretical underpinnings of reinforcement learning and control theory, with a particular interest in developing rigorous frameworks that bridge the gap between learning-based decision-making and classical control methodologies.
